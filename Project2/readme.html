        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <p>One of my personal goals for JavaScript is to integrate the knowledge I’ve gained in class into my hobby of creating games.
            I’ve always have worked in C# when doing game design, so I have been eager to accomplish something similar in JavaScript.
            <br><br>
            This game will operate similarly to other iterations of the “Jumper” style browser-game. The Jumper-style browser game features 
            a continuously sideways-scrolling screen populated with randomly generated obstacles. The player controls a sprite that has one 
            function – to jump. The object of the game is to jump over the obstacles as they scroll past the player. The more obstacles you 
            jump, the higher your score. Touch an obstacle, and you die!
            <br><br>
            Grilling Spree is a simple game – you are the grill. Jump the burgers, or you lose. 
            <br><br><br>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>
                Game Canvas – a window that arranges and displays all of the game elements.<br>
                Dynamic player controls – player sprite responds to mouse clicks.<br>
                Injection of Elements – elements such as player sprites and crates will be dynamically added to the page.<br>
                Movement – dynamic movement of elements in the scene.<br>
                Score system - a player’s score will be counted during each playthrough.<br>
                Player death - the player dies when contacting an object.<br>
                Score display -  player’s score will be displayed upon “death”.<br>
                Reset -  the game will allow the player to click to reset the game in order to play again.<br>
                High score: when the player plays again, the highest score of previous rounds is displayed.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
            
            <h4>Game Canvas</h4>
            <p>The game canvas will be defined in CSS and as a special div object in HTML.</p>
            <h4>Player Movement</h4>
            <p>In order to get the player to “jump” when a mouse click is input, we define the object’s animation in the CSS file.
            This is done by using the “.animate” property in CSS to define the jump, then using @keyframes to dictate the object’s 
            position at a particular moment. The Jump() function in JavaScript just tells us to animate the object using the rules
            defined in the CSS. It also sets a delay function for the jump, and adds the function back so that it can be called again, 
            which allows for multiple jumps. An event listener is then added to handle the Jump() function in the JavaScript file so 
            it can be called when the player presses any button.</p>
            <h4>Obstacle Movement</h4>
            <p>The movement of the burgers (obstacles) will be partially defined with @keyframes in the CSS file, but the animation is 
            simpler, and so the rest can be done in the JavaScript file. They will move constantly until the event that the player 
            collides with a burger, then their animation will stop, and finally resume when the player plays again.</p>
            <h4>Score Counting</h4>
            <p>The score system is actually part of the “CheckDead()” function in JavaScript that uses a conditional statement (if) 
            to check for the player's death. If the player has not yet died, then the score counter continues to add points.</p>
            <h4>Player Death/ Game Over</h4>
            <p>The player death is a function in the JavaScript file that checks for the player’s position relative to the obstacle 
                in the scene. If the player and the obstacle are occupying the same space, then the player death function is called.</p>
            <h4>Score Display</h4>
            <p>The score display is also built into the player’s CheckDead() function in the JavaScript file. We just use a simple alert 
                function to be called when the CheckDead() condition is triggered.</p>
            <h4>High Score</h4>
            <p>While the player has the browser open, each time the player dies, their score will be saved into an array in the JavaScript 
                file. Each time the player dies, the printScores() function will use a for loop to iterate through the array of scores, and 
                save the highest one into a variable called highScore.</p>
            <h4>Reset</h4>
            <p>Finally, the game is reset in the CheckDead() function by pausing the game to display results, and resetting the player’s
                 score to zero.</p>
